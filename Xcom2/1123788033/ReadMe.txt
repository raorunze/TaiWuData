Doubles the amount of ability points you get for tactical actions like flanking shots and ambushing enemies.

Doesn't alter the rewards for beating or killing the Chosen, Alien Rulers, and Julian, but the values are included, and there is a rebalance you can enable if you think beating Julian shouldn't net you 15 AP.

If you want to increase the amount of AP you get from a battle without increasing the values of individual actions, just add 2 to the value of MaxTacticalEventAbilityPointsPerBattle in the mod's config file. By default, it's set to 4 (2x any one tactical action).
