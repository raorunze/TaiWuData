	<ItemDescription>[b]IMPORTANT:[/b] Load this mod before other mods that edit Crimson Court sets or trinkets, such as Better Trinkets.

[b]Note:[/b] This mod was &quot;balanced&quot; with 3 other mods in mind: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=884767042]Three Trinkets by Oks[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=884738151&amp;searchtext=better+trinkets]Better Trinkets by Oks[/url], and the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=927360681]Heroes Unchained series of mods by Loklin[/url]. Because of this, there are some changes that won&apos;t have an impact on the base game, such as bleed chance on the antiquarian. Apart from that, this mod is completely usable on its own. Also, as a small disclaimer, the new set trinkets and their effects are pretty strong, a lot stronger than most if not all trinkets in the base game. If you don&apos;t like mods that add powerful content, this might not be for you.

Do you wish the set trinkets in Crimson Court were better? Do you want them to be close to the best possible trinkets you can have for each class? Well, I did, and that&apos;s why I made this mod. With Better Sets, all of the set trinkets and their set effects are made top tier, with stats and effects that embody what I think each class should be.
