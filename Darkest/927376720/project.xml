	<ItemDescription>[b]FULLY COMPATIBLE WITH CRIMSON COURT[/b]
	
	[h1][b]Heroes Unchained[/b] rebalances many stats and skills of each classes: the goal is to offer more variety by buffing the &quot;useless&quot; abilities while also giving every class a more unique aspect.[/h1]

This mod does not intend to break the game but on the contrary to make it more balanced by creating new skill and classes synergies.
	
Be sure to check out my other Heroes Unchained reworks.

Feedback and ideas are greatly appreciated!
